- 👋 Hi, I’m @GuisandeGolfer
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, PC gaming, mechanical keyboards, productivity apps, and fixing my problems with code. 
- 🌱 I’m trying to learn more about python and vim at the moment. I want to be a Site Reliability engineer, or work in Software Development in my future career.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I think are very interesting or useful.
- 📫 The best way to reach me would be to email me at DGuisande873@gmail.com.
