- 👋 Hi, I’m @GuisandeGolfer
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, PC gaming, mechanical keyboards, productivity apps, and fixing my problems with code. 
- 🌱 I’m trying to learn more about python and vim at the moment. I am actively trying to get my first position in Software Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I can add value to.
